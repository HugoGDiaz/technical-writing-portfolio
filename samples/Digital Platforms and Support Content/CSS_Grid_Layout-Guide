# CSS Grid Layout Guide
*Step-by-step guide to building structured, responsive page layouts with CSS Grid.*

## Overview
CSS Grid is a powerful layout system designed for building two-dimensional layouts on the web. It allows developers to control rows and columns simultaneously, making it ideal for page-level layouts and complex UI structures.

This guide introduces CSS Grid through practical examples and clear explanations, focusing on when and how to use it effectively.

## When to Use CSS Grid
CSS Grid is best suited for layouts where structure matters more than content flow.

Use CSS Grid when you need to:
- Define clear rows and columns
- Build page layouts (headers, sidebars, main content, footers)
- Align elements both horizontally and vertically
- Create responsive layouts without heavy media query logic

## Core Concepts

### Grid Container
A grid layout starts by defining a grid container:

```css
display: grid;
```

This enables grid behavior for all direct children.

### Grid Tracks (Rows and Columns)
You define the grid structure using rows and columns:

```css
grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
```

The `fr` unit represents a fraction of available space.

### Grid Items
Each direct child of the grid container becomes a grid item and can be positioned explicitly or implicitly.

## Creating a Basic Grid Layout
Example: a simple page layout with header, main content, sidebar, and footer.

- The page is divided into two columns  
- The header and footer span across both columns  
- The main content and sidebar sit side by side  

This structure makes layout intent explicit and easy to maintain.

---

## Positioning Items in the Grid
Grid items can be placed using line numbers:

```css
grid-column: 1 / 3;
grid-row: 2 / 3;
```

This approach allows precise placement without relying on source order.

Alternatively, grid areas can be used to make layouts more readable.

---

## Using Grid Template Areas
Grid template areas provide a visual way to define layouts:

- You name areas in the grid container  
- You assign elements to those named areas  

This method improves readability and makes layout changes easier.

It is especially useful in documentation and team environments where clarity matters.

---

## Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid
CSS Grid adapts naturally to responsive design.

Common strategies include:
- Using `fr` units instead of fixed widths  
- Switching grid structures with media queries  
- Redefining grid template areas for smaller screens  

This allows layouts to change structure without rewriting HTML.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using Grid when Flexbox would be simpler  
- Over-specifying grid lines when auto-placement would work  
- Mixing layout responsibilities between Grid and Flexbox without clear intent  

CSS Grid works best when it controls structure, not micro-alignment.
