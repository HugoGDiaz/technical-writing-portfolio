# Letter to the Editor — Structured Writing Workflow

## Goal

This guide standardizes the structure of a formal letter to the editor.  
It is designed to help writers communicate complaints or concerns clearly,
persuasively, and with a defined outcome.

The workflow focuses on clarity, argument structure, and actionable messaging.

---

## Workflow Structure

### 1. Address Block

Include both sender and recipient details.

- Sender name and address
- Recipient name and publication
- Date

This establishes accountability and formal context.

---

### 2. Greeting

Use a formal greeting.

Examples:

- Dear Editor,
- Dear Editorial Team,
- To whom it may concern,

Avoid informal language.

---

### 3. Purpose Statement

State the reason for writing immediately.

The first paragraph must answer:

- What is the issue?
- Why are you writing?

The reader should understand the complaint without searching for context.

---

### 4. Argument Section

Support the complaint with structured reasoning.

Organize the argument into:

- description of the issue
- impact on readers or the public
- evidence or reference
- logical explanation

Avoid emotional or vague language.  
Focus on clarity and credibility.

---

### 5. Call to Action

Specify what action is expected from the editor.

Examples:

- publish a correction
- withdraw an advertisement
- review editorial policy
- address the concern publicly

A complaint without a requested outcome weakens the message.

---

### 6. Closing

End with a professional sign-off.

Examples:

- Kind regards,
- Sincerely,
- Respectfully,

Include full name.

---

## Common Writing Mistakes

- unclear purpose in the opening paragraph
- emotional tone replacing factual argument
- excessive background details
- missing call to action
- informal closing

---

## Final Checklist

☐ Purpose stated in the first paragraph  
☐ Argument supported logically  
☐ Requested action clearly defined  
☐ Professional tone maintained  
☐ Formal structure followed
